# Programs in Machine Code

## About The Project

These programs were part of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID) of University of Patras curriculum.

## Exercises
1. Implementation of basic commands
2. Implementation of memory addressing methods
3. Implementation of assembly commands
4. Implementation of a stack
5. Implementation of basic RISC commands
- **Note**: Since the first exercise was introductory and no actual code was written, there is no folder representing the exercise.
